What is The Cypherfunks?
----------------

"The Cypherfunks" is a grand new experiment in music and cryptocurrencies. It is a decentralized band anyone can be a part: a freely affiliated amorphous music collective, an "open source" band. Everyone can make, create, remix, share, produce, reproduce, cover all the songs under the "The Cypherfunks" monniker. Anyone can even gig as "The Cypherfunks". Attempting to be the world's largest and most diverse band. We are ALL "The Cypherfunks".

Backing this idea, is a cryptocurrency (like Bitcoin and Dogecoin). We tip, trade and transact with  other Cypherfunks. If we release great music, we all can reap the benefits together.
